# Migrate away from Windows #

## The problem
Windows has a number of problems:
* Microsoft increasingly makes it impossible to run without a Microsoft Account.
* Windows has an increasing amount of spyware.
* Windows runs more and more services in the background, slowing down the PC.

## The solution
Migrate away from Windows using the following steps:
* Migrate away from Windows-only software toward cross platform options.
* Install Linux on your machine, if possible on a spare SSD.
* Try to run the remaining Windows only programs on linux using compatibility layers like wine, proton, dosbox.
* Run the remaining Windows-only programs in a minimal Windows installation that runs in a virtual machine like Qemu or Virtualbox. 

## The starting point
We start with a standard PC running Windows.

## The procedure
### Migrate towards cross platform programs
