# FPGA based keyboard #

## The problem
My current keyboard doesn't have a suspend key

## The solution
Implement a USB keyboard in a FPGA.

## Used hardware
### Colorlight 5A-75E Ice40 FPGA board
Can be bought here: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005008745921271.html

### USB blaster
Can be bought here: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005009245070868.html
### Dupond wires
### One button
This button will be used as a suspend key
### A x86-64 PC.
Arch Linux doesn't run well on Arm or Risc-V

## The starting point
We start with an Arch linux machine running Xorg and LXDE.


## The procedure
### Install software on the PC
### Make electrical connections with the colorlight board
### Make logical connection with the FPGA board
### Back-up the original gateware
### Upload the keyboard gateware
### Testing the FPGA based keyboard


## The costs
HD space
RAM
Hardwae: about .. euro's


## The result


## Reverting the change
Install the original gataway on the colorlight card
