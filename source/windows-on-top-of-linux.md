# Windows on top of Linux #

## The problem
There are programs that have no Linux version, and also no program that's functional equivalent. In this guide we pretend notepad++ can't run on Linux.

## The solution
Windows can run in a virtual machine, on top of Linux. 

## The starting point
We start with a Arch linux machine running Xorg and LXDE.

## The procedure


## The costs
Windows takes xxx MB or RAM, and xx GB of hard drive space.

## The result
Windows can be started, and notepad++ can be started.

## Reverting the change
To revert the change, take these steps to remove Windows, and uninstall the packets used to run the VM.
